# Voice Sentiment Analyzer
A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network based voice sentiment analyzer.
<br> The model can effectively analyze 7 fundamental emotions of Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality, Sadness and Surprise.
<br> It was trained on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. This has caused some inherent limitations to the generalizability of the model.
<br> As TESS currently has only two female voice actors and was recorded in a studio setting this model is not at par at being deemed worthy of direct production.
<br> The code is in the jupyternotebook file and is well documented.
